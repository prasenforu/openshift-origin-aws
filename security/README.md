# Audit & security in Openshift

Audit is a feature that logs requests at the API server level, these logs are output to a log file on the master node. This auditing called "Advance Audit" in Openshift. Advanced audit is an enhancement over the older basic audit. Whereas the basic audit logged all requests to an audit file, advanced audit allows administrators to write a policy file to specify a subset of requests that get logged. Advanced audit also offers a webhook which can be used to send audit logs to a log aggregator via http or https.

### Enable Audit in Openshift

Enable audit create lots of log based on audit policy so prepare the policy as much as less.

#### Step #1

Write the policy file below to /etc/origin/master/audit-policy.yaml.

```
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Policy
rules:
  - level: Metadata
    userGroups: ["system:authenticated:oauth"]
    verbs: ["create", "delete"]
    resources:
      - group: "project.openshift.io"
        resources: ["projectrequests", "projects"]
    omitStages:
      - RequestReceived
```

#### Step #2

Create a directory called /etc/origin/master/audit on the master. This directory will contain audit logs produced by advanced audit.

```mkdir /etc/origin/master/audit```

#### Step #3

Setting up webhook, which is a kubeconfig-like file can be created to forward the logs to send logs to an aggregator external to OpenShift.

```vi /etc/origin/master/audit-webhook.yaml```

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: falco
  cluster:
    server: http://$FALCO_SERVICE_CLUSTERIP:8765/k8s_audit
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: falco
    user: ""
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
preferences: {}
users: []
```

#### Step #4

Modify or add below content in  /etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml to enable the auditing feature.

```
...
auditConfig:
  auditFilePath: /var/log/audit-ocp.log
  enabled: true
  maximumFileRetentionDays: 10
  maximumFileSizeMegabytes: 10
  maximumRetainedFiles: 10
  logFormat: json
  policyFile: /etc/origin/master/audit-policy.yaml
  webHookKubeConfig: /etc/origin/master/audit-webhook.yaml
  webHookMode: blocking
...

```

#### Step #5

Restart the api server & check api and controllers are running.

```
master-restart api;master-restart controllers

oc get pod -n kube-system
```

#### Step #6

Testing

Letâ€™s see what this looks like once everything is configured properly. Use the oc binary to create a new project.

```oc new-project test-project```

You can see logs geneted in audit logs file ```/var/log/audit-ocp.log```.
